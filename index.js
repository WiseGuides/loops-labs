/*
1. Use a for loop to count from 100 to 150, outputting the number on each iteration.
*/

/*
2. Use a for loop to count backwards from 10 to 1, outputting the number on each iteration.
*/

/*
3. Create a while loop that loops until the results of calling randomBoolean returns true. On each iteration, output "Now in interation <n> with a result of <true|false>"

function randomBoolean() {
  return Math.random() > 0.8;
}
*/

/*
4. The only problem with Exercise 3 is that it might not execute at all. Change to a do...while loop.
*/

/*
5. The variable, 'arguments', is available within a function. It's an array-like structure that gives you access to all arguments passed into the function. Create a function that accepts several arguments. Inside the function, use the for...of loop to iterate over arguments, outputting the data type of each argument.
*/

/*
6. Use for for...of loop to output the value of each member of this Set:
let mySet = new Set(1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55);
